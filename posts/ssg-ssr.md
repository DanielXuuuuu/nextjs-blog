We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export function getDocBySlug(slug) {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.md$/, '');
  const docsDirectory = join(process.cwd(), 'docs');
  const fullPath = join(docsDirectory, `${realSlug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  return { slug: realSlug, meta: data, content };
}
console.log('hello world!')
```
